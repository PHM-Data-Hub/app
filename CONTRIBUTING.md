# Getting started
### Code Changes
For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
   * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.

### Smaller Changes

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted on the [Small Patches Issue](https://github.com/machine-data-hub/app/issues/52). Examples of these are:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.

# How to report a bug
Bugs should be posted in Issues with the 'bug' label. 

Any security issues should be submitted directly to conduct@machinedatahub.ai.
In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
 * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
 * Can I disable something for other people?

 If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at conduct@machinedatahub.ai.
