    "ShortSummary": "The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant. A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is composed of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST) and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines, which are combined in one cycle, and is transferred from one turbine to another. While the Vacuum is collected from and has effect on the Steam Turbine, he other three of the ambient variables effect the GT performance. For comparability with our baseline studies, and to allow 5x2 fold statistical tests be carried out, we provide the data shuffled five times. For each shuffling 2-fold CV is carried out and the resulting 10 measurements are used for statistical testing.",

The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is more risky than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price. Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale. Actuarians call this process \"symboling\". A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.\n\nThe third factor is the relative average loss payment per insured vehicle year. This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two-door small, station wagons, sports/speciality, etc...), and represents the average loss per car per year.",

    "ShortSummary": "Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.\nThe dataset contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.",

The sensor set included one mono-RGB camera, one stereo-RGB camera, an inertial measurement system with differential GPS and a lidar system.

For each track and at each time-step, not only the agent position is provided, but also body and head orientation attributes, as well as the position of all other agents and their type (e.g. car, cyclist, pedestrian etc.).",

    "Summary": "Attackers have the ability to intercept and add/remove medical evidence in medical imagery with high realism using deep learning. In this dataset we present medical deepfakes: 3D CT scans of human lungs, where some have been tampered with real cancer removed and with fake cancer injected. The objective of this dataset is to distinguish between real and fake cancers, and identify where medical scans have been tampered. Three expert radiologists have evaluated this dataset and could not reliably tell the difference between real and fake cancers, meaning that the fake cancers are realistic and this detection task is very challenging. For more information, please see our paper 'CT-GAN'.",

The raw accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data is collected from the smartphone and smartwatch at a rate of 20Hz. It is collected from 51 test subjects as they perform 18 activities for 3 minutes apiece. The sensor data for each device (phone, watch) and type of sensor (accelerometer, gyroscope) is stored in a different directory (so there are 4 data directories). In each directory there are 51 files corresponding to the 51 test subjects. The format of every entry is the same: . The descriptions of these attributes are provided with the attribute information. In addition to the raw time-series sensor data we also generate examples that describe the sensor data using a 10-second window. See the dataset description document for details. Although this data can most naturally be used for activity recognition, it can also be used to build behavioral biometric models since each sensor reading is associated with a specific subject.",
